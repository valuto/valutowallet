        <div class="body">
            ValutoWallet is a free, open-source interface to the Valuto blockchain.<br><br>

            It allows you to interact directly with the blockchain, while remaining in full control of your addresses & your funds.<br><br>


            <strong>You and <u>only</u> you are responsible for your security.<br>
            Always choose strong passwords and utilize two factor authentication.<br><br>

            Only use ValutoWallet and Valuto (VLU), if you are familiar with digital assets and the risks associated.</strong>

        <div class="body">
            <ul>
                <li>When you open a bank account, they create an account in their system for you, upon an agreement.</li>
                <li>The bank keeps track of all personal information, private data, balances, transactions etc.</li>
                <li>When you have an account at a bank, they are in definite control over your funds and provide all services needed.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>ValutoWallet is NONE of these things.<br>
            The sole responsibility for managing your ValutoWallet, loss of funds etc., lies on you as a private user.</strong></p>

        <div class="body">
            <ul>
                <li>When you create an account, the server at valutowallet.com is generating a cryptographic set of numbers, i.e. your private key and your public key (address).</li>
                <li>The handling of your keys happens entirely on our system. </li>
                <li>Valutowallet is indemnified in regards to any loss of funds, damage to businesses or similar events.</li>
                <li>When you use Valutowallet to interfere on the Valuto blockchain network, we do not charge a fee. There could however be fees involved in a transaction, which are decided by the network, depending on load etc.</li>
                <li>You are using the interface to interact directly with the blockchain, sending funds to a wrong address WILL result in loss of funds. </li>
                <li>If you send your VLU Address to someone, they can transfer VLU to you. </li>
                <li>If you send your private keys to someone, they now have full control of the account associated with it. </li>

        <div class="body">
            <ul>
                <li>A blockchain is a huge, global, distributed (i.e. decentralized) ledger, similar to a spreadsheet.</li>
                <li>It keeps track of who sent how many coins to whom, and what the balance of every account is. </li>
                <li>It is stored, secured and maintained by thousands of people (miners), across the globe. </li>
                <li>The blocks in the blockchain are made up of all transactions from the ValutoWallet, valutod core, ValutoPy or other compatible wallets.</li>
                <li>When you see your balance on ValutoWallet / view your transactions on vluchain.info, you are looking at data currently present on the blockchain, and not our servers. </li>
